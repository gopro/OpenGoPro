Camera Capabilities
===================

Camera capabilities usually change from one camera to another and often change from one release to the next. Below are
documents that detail whitelists for basic video settings for every supported camera release.

These capability documents define supported camera states. Each state is comprised of a set of setting options that are
presented in **dependency order**. This means each state is guaranteed to be attainable if and only if the setting options
are set in the order presented. Failure to adhere to dependency ordering may result in the camera's blacklist rules
rejecting a `Set Setting <settings.html#set_setting>`_ command.

============= ========= =================== ========= ========= ================ =================
Camera        Command 1 Command 2           Command 3 Command 4 Command 5        Guaranteed Valid?
============= ========= =================== ========= ========= ================ =================
Hero 10 Black Res: 1080 Anti-Flicker: 60 Hz FPS: 240  FOV: Wide Hypersmooth: Off ✔
Hero 10 Black Res: 240  Anti-Flicker: 60 Hz RES: 1080 FOV: Wide Hypersmooth: off ❌
============= ========= =================== ========= ========= ================ =================

In the example above, the first set of commands will always work for basic video presets such as Standard.

In the second example, suppose the camera's Video Resolution was previously set to 4K. If the user tries to set Video FPS
to 240, it will fail because 4K/240fps is not supported.

Capability documents for each camera / firmware version can be found in the following file formats:

XLSX
----

An XLSX file can be found `here <https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro/blob/main/docs/specs/capabilities.xlsx>`__.

The capabilities spreadsheet contains worksheets for every supported release. Each row in a worksheet represents a
whitelisted state and is presented in dependency order as outlined above.

JSON
----

A JSON file can be found `here <https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro/blob/main/docs/specs/capabilities.json>`__.

The capabilities JSON contains a set of whitelist states for every supported release. Each state is comprised of a list
of objects that contain setting and option IDs necessary to construct
`Set Setting <settings.html#set_setting>`_ commands and are given in dependency
order as outlined above. For more information on the object format, see the JSON schema

Operations
==========

.. operation:tlv-command:: Set Setting
    :operation-id: GPCAMERA_CHANGE_SETTING
    :external:
    :id: SettingID

    Set an individual :ref:`Setting ID<protocol/id_tables:setting ids>` to a given value.

    The superset of per-setting values can be found in the :ref:`Setting ID<protocol/id_tables:setting ids>` documentation. Alternatively,
    the currently supported setting values can be dynamically queried via :operation:ref:`Get Setting Capabilities`

    .. operation:tlv-message:: Request
        :uuid: Setting
        :params:
            - value_length (uint8): length of value
            - value (variable length and type): value to set, of length value_length
    .. operation:tlv-message:: Response
        :uuid: Settings Response
