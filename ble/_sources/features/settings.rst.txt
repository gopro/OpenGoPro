Settings
********

GoPro cameras have hundreds of setting options to choose from. Since these options have a complex tree of dependencies
on camera state, current Preset, etc, there is no mechanism to set a desired setting option from any camera state.

To find the currently available options for a given setting, use the capability querying operations:

- :operation:ref:`Get Setting Capabilities`
- :operation:ref:`Register for Setting Capability Updates`

Operations
==========

.. operation:tlv-command:: Set Setting
    :operation-id: GPCAMERA_CHANGE_SETTING
    :external:
    :id: SettingID

    Set an individual :ref:`Setting ID<protocol/id_tables:setting ids>` to a given value.

    The superset of per-setting values can be found in the :ref:`Setting ID<protocol/id_tables:setting ids>` documentation. Alternatively,
    the currently supported setting values can be dynamically queried via :operation:ref:`Get Setting Capabilities`

    .. operation:tlv-message:: Request
        :uuid: Setting
        :params:
            - value_length (uint8): length of value
            - value (variable length and type): value to set, of length value_length
    .. operation:tlv-message:: Response
        :uuid: Settings Response
