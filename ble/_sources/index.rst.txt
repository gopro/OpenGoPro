Welcome to Open GoPro BLE API's documentation!
**********************************************

This document describes the format, capabilities, and use of
`Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) <https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy>`_ as it pertains to communicating
with GoPro cameras via the Open GoPro API.

Supported Cameras
=================

Below is a table of cameras that support GoPro's public BLE API:

.. include:: included_cameras.inc

Getting Started
===============

First, read through the protocol section to understand how to send and receive BLE messages via the Open GoPro
protocol:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  protocol

Then see any of the subsequent feature sections to perform desired functionality:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  features/control
  features/query
  features/access_points
  features/live_streaming
  features/cohn
  features/hilights
  features/presets
  features/settings
  features/statuses
  features/cah

.. tip:: Additionally, there are walk-through
    `tutorials <https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/tutorials/>`_  available to demonstrate basic BLE functionality
    as well as complete `demos <https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro/tree/main/demos>`_ in various programming languages.

Limitations
===========

General
-------

- The camera will reject requests to change settings while encoding; for example, if Hindsight feature is active, the
  user can not change settings
- Querying the value for a setting that is not associated with the current preset/core mode results in an undefined value.
  For example, the user should not try to query the current Photo Digital Lenses (FOV) value while in a video-based
  Preset.
