State Management
****************

Camera Readiness
================

Depending on the camera's state, it may not be ready to accept specific commands. This ready state is dependent on the
:operation:ref:`System Busy<Status 8>` and :operation:ref:`Encoding Active<Status 10>` status flags. For example:

- System Busy flag is set while loading presets, changing settings, formatting sdcard, ...
- Encoding Active flag is set while capturing photo/video media

If the system is not ready, it should reject an incoming command; however, best practice is to always wait for the
System Busy and Encode Active flags to be unset before sending messages other than get status/setting queries.

Keep Alive
==========

Unless changed by the user, GoPro cameras will automatically power off after some time (e.g. 5min, 15min, 30min).
Therefore, it is necessary to periodically send a :operation:ref:`Keep Alive` signal to maintain the connection.

Camera Control
==============

In order to prevent undefined behavior between the camera and a connected app, simultaneous use of the camera and a
connected app is discouraged. A third party client should use :operation:ref:`Set Camera Control` to tell the camera
that the client wishes to claim control of the camera.
