## Features

-   Top-level GoPro class interface to use BLE, WiFi, and / or USB
-   Cross-platform (tested on MacOS Big Sur, Windows 10, and Ubuntu 20.04)
    -   BLE implemented using [bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/)
    -   Wi-Fi controller provided in the Open GoPro package (loosely based on the [Wireless Library](https://pypi.org/project/wireless/)
-   Supports all commands, settings, and statuses from the [Open GoPro API](https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/)
-   Automatically handles connection maintenance:
    -   manage camera ready / encoding
    -   periodically sends keep alive signals
-   Includes detailed logging for each module
-   Includes demo scripts installed as command-line applications to show BLE, WiFi, and USB functionality such as:
    -   Take a photo
    -   Take a video
    -   Configure and view a GoPro webcam stream
    -   GUI to send all commands and view the live / preview stream
    -   Log the battery

## Installation

> Note! This package requires Python >= 3.8 and <=3.10

```console
    $ pip install open-gopro
```

## Usage

To automatically connect to GoPro device via BLE and WiFI, set the preset, set video parameters, take a
video, and download all files:

```python
import time
from open_gopro import GoPro, Params

with GoPro() as gopro:
    gopro.ble_command.load_preset(Params.Preset.CINEMATIC)
    gopro.ble_setting.resolution.set(Params.Resolution.RES_4K)
    gopro.ble_setting.fps.set(Params.FPS.FPS_30)
    gopro.ble_command.set_shutter(Params.Shutter.ON)
    time.sleep(2) # Record for 2 seconds
    gopro.ble_command.set_shutter(Params.Shutter.OFF)

    # Download all of the files from the camera
    media_list = [x["n"] for x in gopro.wifi_command.get_media_list().flatten
    for file in media_list:
        gopro.wifi_command.download_file(camera_file=file)
```

And much more!

## Demos

> Note! These demos can be found on [Github](https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro/tree/main/demos/python/sdk_wireless_camera_control/open_gopro/demos)

Demos can be found in the installed package in the "demos" folder. They are installed as a CLI entrypoint
and can be run via:

Capture a photo and download it to your computer:

```bash
$ gopro-photo
```

Capture a video and download it to your computer:

```bash
$ gopro-video
```

Start the preview stream and view it:

```bash
$ gopro-preview-stream
```

Start the live stream and view it:

```bash
$ gopro-live-stream
```

Connect to the GoPro and log battery consumption in to a .csv:

```bash
$ gopro-log-battery
```

Connect to the GoPro's Wi-Fi AP and maintain the connection:

```bash
$ gopro-wifi
```

For more information on each, try running with help as such:

```bash
$ gopro-photo --help

usage: gopro-photo [-h] [-i IDENTIFIER] [-l LOG] [-o OUTPUT] [-w WIFI_INTERFACE]

Connect to a GoPro camera, take a photo, then download it.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IDENTIFIER, --identifier IDENTIFIER
                        Last 4 digits of GoPro serial number, which is the last 4 digits of the default camera SSID. If not used, first
                        discovered GoPro will be connected to
  -l LOG, --log LOG     Location to store detailed log
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Where to write the photo to. If not set, write to 'photo.jpg'
  -w WIFI_INTERFACE, --wifi_interface WIFI_INTERFACE
                        System Wifi Interface. If not set, first discovered interface will be used.
```
