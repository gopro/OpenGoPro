```

## Features

-   Top-level GoPro class interface to use both BLE / WiFi
-   Cross-platform (tested on MacOS Big Sur, Windows 10, and Ubuntu 20.04)
    -   BLE implemented using `bleak <https://pypi.org/project/bleak/>`\_
    -   Wi-Fi controller provided in the Open GoPro package (loosely based on the `Wireless Library <https://pypi.org/project/wireless/>`\_ )
-   Supports all `Open GoPro API's <https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro>`\_
-   Automatically handles some required functionality:
    -   manage camera ready / encoding
    -   periodically sends keep alive signals
-   Includes demo scripts installed as command-line applications to show BLE and WiFi functionality

## Usage

To automatically connect to GoPro device via BLE and WiFI, take a video, and download all files:

```python
from open_gopro import GoPro, params

with GoPro() as gopro:
    gopro.ble_command.load_preset(params.Preset.CINEMATIC)
    gopro.ble_setting.resolution.set(params.Resolution.RES_5k)
    gopro.ble_setting.fps.set(params.FPS.FPS_30)
    gopro.ble_command.set_shutter(params.Shutter.ON)
    time.sleep(2) # Record for 2 seconds
    gopro.ble_command.set_shutter(params.Shutter.OFF)

    # Download all of the files from the camera
    media_list = [x["n"] for x in gopro.wifi_command.get_media_list()["media"][0]["fs"]]
    for file in media_list:
        gopro.wifi_command.download_file(camera_file=file)
```

And much more!

## Demos

> Note! These demos can be found on [Github](https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro/tree/main/demos/python/sdk_wireless_camera_control/open_gopro/demos)

Demos can be found in the installed package in the "demos" folder. They are installed as a CLI entrypoint
and can be run via:

```bash

```

```bash
$ gopro-stream
```

For more information on each, try running with help as such:

```bash
$ gopro-photo --help
