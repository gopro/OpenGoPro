Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up Open GoPro for local development.

Minimal Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Python (3.9 or higher)
* `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`_ : Needed to install dependencies / development tasks

Additional Optional Requirements:

* `protoc <https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/>`_  to build protobuf python files from .proto's
* `graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`_  to build diagrams in sphinx

Steps
~~~~~

#. Fork the Open GoPro repo on GitHub.
#. Clone your fork locally:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/OpenGoPro.git

#. Enter the sdk_wireless_camera_control directory:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cd OpenGoPro/demos/python/sdk_wireless_camera_control

#. Create a branch for local development, originating from the `main` branch:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature main

#. Install your local copy into a virtual environment.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ poetry install

#. Make your changes locally. When you're done making changes, check that your changes are:

    * formatted
    * pass type checking
    * pass linting
    * pass unit tests
    * pass docstring tests

    .. code-block:: console

        $ poetry run poe all

    Note that each of these checks can be run individually. For more information, see:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ poetry run poe --help

#. Commit your changes, push your branch to GitHub, and submit a pull request into `main`. Once the Pull Request is made,
   Github Actions will test the changes across multiple OS's and Python versions.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

#. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. The docs can be build locally via:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ poetry run poe docs

#. Modify the ``CHANGELOG.rst``.
#. The pull request should work for Python 3.8 - 3.10 on the following platforms:

    - Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update) and greater
    - Linux distributions with BlueZ >= 5.43
    - OS X / macOS >= 10.11

#. Feel free to add your name as a contributor to the ``AUTHORS.rst`` file!
