Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up Open GoPro for local development.

#. Fork the Open GoPro repo on GitHub.
#. Clone your fork locally:

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/OpenGoPro.git

#. Enter the sdk_wireless_camera_control directory:

    $ cd OpenGoPro/demos/python/sdk_wireless_camera_control

#. Install your local copy into a virtual environment. The activation directory may vary based on your OS

    $ python -m venv venv
    $ source ./venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements.txt

4. Create a branch for local development, originating from the `main` branch::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature main

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass pylint and the tests:

    $ make lint tests

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
2. Modify the ``CHANGELOG.rst``.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.8+ on the following platforms:
    - Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update) and greater
    - Linux distributions with BlueZ >= 5.43
    - OS X / macOS >= 10.11
4. Squash all your commits on your PR branch, if the commits are not solving
    different problems and you are committing them in the same PR. In that case,
    consider making several PRs instead.
5. Feel free to add your name as a contributor to the ``AUTHORS.rst`` file!
