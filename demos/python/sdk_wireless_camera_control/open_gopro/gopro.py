    See `Open GoPro <https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/python_sdk>`_ for complete documentation.

    This will handle for BLE:

    - discovering device
    - establishing connections
    - discovering GATT characteristics
    - enabling notifications
    - discovering Open GoPro version
    - transferring data

    This will handle for Wifi:

    - finding SSID and password
    - establishing Wifi connection
    - transferring data

    It will also do some synchronization, etc:

    - ensuring camera is ready / not encoding before transferring data
    - sending keep alive signal periodically

    If no target arg is passed in, the first discovered GoPro device will be connected to.

    It can be used via context manager:

    >>> with GoPro() as gopro:
    >>>     gopro.ble_command.set_shutter(gopro.params.Shutter.ON)

    Or without:

    >>> gopro = GoPro()
    >>> gopro.open()

    >>> gopro.close()

        ble_adapter (BLEController, optional): Class used to control computer's BLE connection / send data.
