## Usage

See the top-level [README](../README.md) for how to use the Docker image defined in this repo
to locally serve the site for development.

## Site layout

The site map can be found after building the site at: `./_site/sitemap.xml`.

## Contribution

There is a contribution guide that describes all of the various features available either via the
minimal mistakes theme, the various Ruby gem plugins, or custom plugins in this repo such as:

-   links
-   callouts
-   figures
-   tabs
-   etc.

The source for the guide is in [contribution.md](contribution.md).

To view its output, serve the site, then go to [localhost:4998/contribution](localhost:4998/contribution)

## Testing

Assuming that python is installed and that the site is currently being served locally, the page can be tested
for any invalid links via the top-level Makefile in this repo:

```
make tests
```
