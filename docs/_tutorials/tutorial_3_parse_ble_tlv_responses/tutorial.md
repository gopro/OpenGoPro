# Tutorial 3: Parse BLE TLV Responses

This document will provide a walk-through tutorial to implement
the [Open GoPro Interface]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}) to parse BLE
[Type-Length-Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value) (TLV) Responses.

Besides TLV, some BLE commands instead return protobuf responses. These are not considered here and will be
discussed in a future tutorial.

{% tip %}
It is suggested that you have first completed the
[connect]({% link _tutorials/tutorial_1_connect_ble/tutorial.md %}#requirements)
and [sending commands]({% link _tutorials/tutorial_2_send_ble_commands/tutorial.md %}) tutorials before going
through this tutorial.
{% endtip %}

This tutorial will give an overview of types of responses, then give examples of parsing each type
before finally providing a **Response** class that will be used in future tutorials.

# Requirements

It is assumed that the hardware and software requirements from the
[connect tutorial]({% link _tutorials/tutorial_1_connect_ble/tutorial.md %})
are present and configured correctly.

# Just Show me the Demo(s)!!

{% linkedTabs demo %}
{% tab demo python %}
Each of the scripts for this tutorial can be found in the Tutorial 2
[directory](https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro/tree/main/demos/python/tutorial/tutorial_modules/tutorial_3_parse_ble_tlv_responses/).

{% warning %}
Python >= 3.8.x must be used as specified in the requirements
{% endwarning %}

{% accordion Parsing a One Packet TLV Response %}

You can test parsing a one packet TLV response with your camera through BLE using the following script:
```console
$ python ble_command_get_version.py
```

See the help for parameter definitions:

```console
$ python ble_command_get_version.py --help
usage: ble_command_get_version.py [-h] [-i IDENTIFIER]

Connect to a GoPro camera via BLE, then get the Open GoPro version.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IDENTIFIER, --identifier IDENTIFIER
                        Last 4 digits of GoPro serial number, which is the last 4 digits of the
                        default camera SSID. If not used, first discovered GoPro will be connected to
```
{% endaccordion %}


{% accordion Parsing Multiple Packet TLV Responses %}

You can test parsing multiple packet TVL responses with your camera through BLE using the following script:
```console
$ python ble_command_get_state.py
```

See the help for parameter definitions:

```console
$ python ble_command_get_state.py --help
usage: ble_command_get_state.py [-h] [-i IDENTIFIER]

Connect to a GoPro camera via BLE, then get its statuses and settings.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IDENTIFIER, --identifier IDENTIFIER
                        Last 4 digits of GoPro serial number, which is the last 4 digits of the
                        default camera SSID. If not used, first discovered GoPro will be connected to
```
{% endaccordion %}

{% endtab %}
{% tab demo kotlin %}
The Kotlin file for this tutorial can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro/tree/main/demos/kotlin/tutorial/app/src/main/java/com/example/open_gopro_tutorial/tutorials/Tutorial3ParseBleTlvResponses.kt).

To perform the tutorial, run the Android Studio project, select "Tutorial 3" from the dropdown and click on "Perform."
This requires that a GoPro is already connected via BLE, i.e. that Tutorial 1 was already run. You can
check the BLE status at the top of the app.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/tutorials/kotlin/tutorial_3.png" alt="kotlin_tutorial_3" size="40%" caption="Perform Tutorial 3" %}

{% endlinkedTabs %}

# Setup

We must first connect as was discussed in the
[connect tutorial]({% link _tutorials/tutorial_1_connect_ble/tutorial.md %}). When enabling notifications,
one of the notification handlers described in the following sections will be used.

# Response Overview

In the preceding tutorials, we have been using a very simple response handling procedure where the notification
handler simply checks that the UUID is the expected UUID and that the status byte of the response is 0 (Success).
This has been fine since we were only sending specific commands where this works and we know that the sequence
always appears as such (connection sequence left out for brevity):

```mermaid!
sequenceDiagram
  participant PC as Open GoPro user device
  participant GoPro
  note over PC, GoPro : devices are connected as in Tutorial 1
  PC ->> GoPro: Write to characteristic
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 0 (start))
```

In actuality, responses can be more complicated. As described in the
[Open GoPro Interface]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}#packet-headers), responses can be
be comprised of multiple packets where each packet is <= 20 bytes such as:

```mermaid!
sequenceDiagram
  participant PC as Open GoPro user device
  participant GoPro
  note over PC, GoPro : devices are connected as in Tutorial 1
  PC ->> GoPro: Write to characteristic
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 0 (start))
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 1 (continuation))
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 1 (continuation))
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 1 (continuation))
```

This requires the implementation of accumulating and parsing algorithms which will be described in
[Parsing Multiple Packet TLV Responses].

# Parsing a One Packet TLV Response

This section will describe how to parse one packet (<= 20 byte) responses. A one-packet response
is formatted as such:

| Header (length) | Command / Setting ID | Status  | Response         |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 1 byte          | 1 byte               | 1 bytes | Length - 2 bytes |

## Command / Setting Responses with Response Length 0

These are the only responses that we have seen thus far through the first 2 tutorials. They
return a status but have a 0 length additional response. For example, consider
[Set Shutter]({% link _tutorials/tutorial_2_send_ble_commands/tutorial.md %}#set-shutter). It returned a response
of:

```
02:01:00
```

This equates to:

| Header (length) | Command / Setting / Status ID | Status          | Response         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 1 byte          | 1 byte                        | 1 bytes         | Length - 2 bytes |
| 0x02            | 0x01 == Set Shutter           | 0x00 == Success | (2 -2 = 0 bytes) |

We can see how this response includes the status but no additional response data. This type of
response will be used for most Commands and Setting Responses as seen in the
[previous tutorial]({% link _tutorials/tutorial_2_send_ble_commands/tutorial.md %}).

## Complex Command Response

There are some commands that do return additional response data. These are called "complex responses."
From the [commands reference]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}#commands-quick-reference), we can see that these are:

-   Get Open GoPro Version (ID == 0x51)
-   Get Hardware Info (ID == 0x3C)

In this tutorial, we will walk through creating a simple parser to parse the Open GoPro Get Version Command.

{% tip %}
It is important to always query the version after connecting in order to know which API is supported.
See the relevant version of the BLE and / or WiFi spec for more details about each version.
{% endtip %}

First, we send the command to the Command Request [UUID]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}#services-and-characteristics):

{% linkedTabs send_command %}
{% tab send_command python %}
```python
COMMAND_REQ_UUID = GOPRO_BASE_UUID.format("0072")
event.clear()
await client.write_gatt_char(COMMAND_REQ_UUID, bytearray([0x01, 0x51]))
await event.wait()  # Wait to receive the notification response
```

We then receive a response at the expected handle. This is logged as:

```console
INFO:root:Getting the Open GoPro version...
INFO:root:Received response at handle=52: b'06:51:00:01:02:01:00'
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab send_command kotlin %}
```kotlin
    val getVersion = ubyteArrayOf(0x01U, 0x51U)
    ble.writeCharacteristic(goproAddress, GoProUUID.CQ_COMMAND.uuid, getVersion)
    val version = receivedResponse.receive() as Response.Complex // Wait to receive response
```

This is loged as such:

```console
Getting the Open GoPro version
Writing characteristic b5f90072-aa8d-11e3-9046-0002a5d5c51b ==> 01:51
Wrote characteristic b5f90072-aa8d-11e3-9046-0002a5d5c51b
Characteristic b5f90073-aa8d-11e3-9046-0002a5d5c51b changed | value: 06:51:00:01:02:01:00
Received response on b5f90073-aa8d-11e3-9046-0002a5d5c51b: 06:51:00:01:02:01:00
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

This response equates to:

| Header (length) | Command / Setting / Status ID | Status          | Response            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 byte          | 1 byte                        | 1 bytes         | Length - 2 bytes    |
| 0x06            | 0x51 == Get Version           | 0x00 == Success | 0x01 0x02 0x01 0x00 |

We can see that this "complex response" contains 4 additional bytes that need to be parsed. Using the information
from the [interface description]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}#complex-command-responses),
we know to parse this as:

| Byte | Meaning                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 0x01 | Length of Major Version Number |
| 0x02 | Major Version Number           |
| 0x01 | Length of Minor Version Number |
| 0x00 | Minor Version Number           |

We implement this in the notification handler as follows. First, we parse the length, command ID, and status
from the first 3 bytes of the response. Then we parse the remaining four bytes of the response as individual
values formatted as such:

| Length | Value        |
| ------ | ------------ |
| 1 byte | Length bytes |

{% linkedTabs parse_response %}
{% tab parse_response python %}
{% note %}
The snippets of code included in this section are taken from the `notification handler`
{% endnote %}


```python
# Parse first 3 bytes
length = data[0]
command_id = data[1]
status = data[2]
```

```python
# Parse remaining four bytes
index = 3
params = []
while index <= length:
    param_len = data[index]
    index += 1
    params.append(data[index : index + param_len])
    index += param_len
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab parse_response kotlin %}
{% note %}
The snippets of code included in this section are taken from the `Response.Complex` `parse` method. For the
contrived code in this tutorial, we have separate `Response` sealed classes to handle each use case.
{% endnote %}

```kotlin
// Parse header bytes
id = packet[0].toInt()
status = packet[1].toInt()
var buf = packet.drop(2)
```

```kotlin
// Parse remaining packet
while (buf.isNotEmpty()) {
    // Get each parameter's ID and length
    val paramLen = buf[0].toInt()
    buf = buf.drop(1)
    // Get the parameter's value
    val paramVal = buf.take(paramLen)
    // Store in data list
    data += paramVal.toUByteArray()
    // Advance the buffer for continued parsing
    buf = buf.drop(paramLen)
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

From the complex response definition, we know these parameters are one byte each and equate to the major and
the minor version so let's print them (and all of the other response information) as such:

{% linkedTabs print_response %}
{% tab print_response python %}
```python
major, minor = params
logger.info(f"Received a response to {command_id=} with {status=}: version={major[0]}.{minor[0]}")
```

which shows on the log as:

```console
INFO:root:Received a response to command_id=81 with status=0: version=2.0
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab print_response kotlin %}
```kotlin
val version = receivedResponse.receive() as Response.Complex // Wait to receive response
val major = version.data[0].first().toInt()
val minor = version.data[1].first().toInt()
Timber.i("Got the Open GoPro version successfully: $major.$minor")
```

which shows on the log as such:

```console
Got the Open GoPro version successfully: 2.0
```


{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

# Parsing Multiple Packet TLV Responses

This section will describe parsing TLV responses that contain more than one packet. It will first describe how
to accumulate such responses and then provide a parsing example. The example script that will be walked through
for this section is `ble_command_get_state.py`. We will be creating a small _Response_ class that will be
re-used for future tutorials.

## Accumulating the Response

The first step is to accumulate the multiple packets into one response. Whereas for all tutorials until now, we
have just used the header bytes of the response as the length, we now must completely parse the header as it is
defined:

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="8">Byte 1</td>
        <td colspan="8">Byte 2 (optional)</td>
        <td colspan="8">Byte 3 (optional)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0: Start</td>
        <td colspan="2">00: General</td>
        <td colspan="5">Message Length: 5 bits</td>
        <td colspan="16"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0: Start</td>
        <td colspan="2">01: Extended (13-bit)</td>
        <td colspan="13">Message Length: 13 bits</td>
        <td colspan="8"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0: Start</td>
        <td colspan="2">10: Extended (16-bit)</td>
        <td colspan="5"></td>
        <td colspan="16">Message Length: 16 bits</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0: Start</td>
        <td colspan="2">11: Reserved</td>
        <td colspan="21"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1: Continuation</td>
        <td colspan="24"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The basic algorithm here (which is implemented in the _Message.accumulate_ method) is as follows:

---

<div class="md_column">
<div markdown="1">
Continuation bit set?

{% linkedTabs is_cont_set %}
{% tab is_cont_set python %}
```python
if buf[0] & CONT_MASK:
    buf.pop(0)
else:
    ...
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab is_cont_set kotlin %}
```kotlin
if (data.first().and(Mask.Continuation.value) == Mask.Continuation.value) {
    buf = buf.drop(1).toUByteArray() // Pop the header byte
} else { // This is a new packet
    ...
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

No, continuation bit was not set. So create new response, then get its length.

{% linkedTabs cont_not_set %}
{% tab cont_not_set python %}
```python
# This is a new packet so start with an empty byte array
self.bytes = bytearray()
hdr = Header((buf[0] & HDR_MASK) >> 5)
if hdr is Header.GENERAL:
    self.bytes_remaining = buf[0] & GEN_LEN_MASK
    buf = buf[1:]
elif hdr is Header.EXT_13:
    self.bytes_remaining = ((buf[0] & EXT_13_BYTE0_MASK) << 8) + buf[1]
    buf = buf[2:]
elif hdr is Header.EXT_16:
    self.bytes_remaining = (buf[1] << 8) + buf[2]
    buf = buf[3:]
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab cont_not_set kotlin %}
```kotlin
// This is a new packet so start with empty array
packet = ubyteArrayOf()
when (Header.fromValue((buf.first() and Mask.Header.value).toInt() shr 5)) {
    Header.GENERAL -> {
        bytesRemaining = buf[0].and(Mask.GenLength.value).toInt()
        buf = buf.drop(1).toUByteArray()
    }
    Header.EXT_13 -> {
        bytesRemaining = ((buf[0].and(Mask.Ext13Byte0.value)
            .toLong() shl 8) or buf[1].toLong()).toInt()
        buf = buf.drop(2).toUByteArray()
    }
    Header.EXT_16 -> {
        bytesRemaining = ((buf[1].toLong() shl 8) or buf[2].toLong()).toInt()
        buf = buf.drop(3).toUByteArray()
    }
    Header.RESERVED -> {
        throw Exception("Unexpected RESERVED header")
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

Append current packet to response and decrement bytes remaining.

{% linkedTabs append_packet %}
{% tab append_packet python %}
```python
# Append payload to buffer and update remaining / complete
self.bytes.extend(buf)
self.bytes_remaining -= len(buf)
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab append_packet kotlin %}
```kotlin
// Accumulate the payload now that headers are handled and dropped
packet += buf
bytesRemaining -= buf.size
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

In the notification handler, we are then parsing if there are no bytes remaining.

{% linkedTabs parse_if_done %}
{% tab parse_if_done python %}
```python
    if response.is_received:
        response.parse()
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab parse_if_done kotlin %}
```kotlin
rsp.accumulate(data)
if (rsp.isReceived) {
    rsp.parse()
    ...
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

</div>

<div markdown="1" style="60%">
<br><br><br>
```mermaid!
graph TD
    A[Read Available Packet] --> C{Continuation bit set?}
    C -->|No| D[Create new empty response]
    D --> I[Get bytes remaining, i.e. length]
    I --> E
    C -->|Yes| E[Append packet to accumulating response]
    E --> |Decrement bytes remaining| F{Bytes remaining == 0?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Parse Received Packet]
    F -->|No| A
```
</div>
</div>

---

We can see this in action when we send the _Get All Setting Values_ Query.

{% note %}
Queries aren't introduced until the next tutorial so for now, just pay attention to the response.
{% endnote %}

We send the command as such:

{% linkedTabs get_all_settings_values %}
{% tab get_all_settings_values python %}
```python
QUERY_REQ_UUID = GOPRO_BASE_UUID.format("0076")
event.clear()
await client.write_gatt_char(QUERY_REQ_UUID, bytearray([0x01, 0x12]))
await event.wait()  # Wait to receive the notification response
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab get_all_settings_values kotlin %}
```kotlin
val getCameraSettings = ubyteArrayOf(0x01U, 0x12U)
ble.writeCharacteristic(goproAddress, GoProUUID.CQ_QUERY.uuid, getCameraSettings)
val settings = receivedResponse.receive()
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

Then, in the notification handler, we continuously receive and accumulate packets until we have
received the entire response, at which point we notify the writer that the response is ready:

{% linkedTabs parse_get_all_settings_values %}
{% tab parse_get_all_settings_values python %}
```python
 def notification_handler(characteristic: BleakGATTCharacteristic, data: bytes) -> None:
        response.accumulate(data)

        if response.is_received:
            response.parse()

            # Notify writer that procedure is complete
            event.set()
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab parse_get_all_settings_values kotlin %}
```kotlin
private fun tlvResponseNotificationHandler(characteristic: UUID, data: UByteArray) {
    ...
    rsp.accumulate(data)
    if (rsp.isReceived) {
        rsp.parse()

        // Notify the command sender the the procedure is complete
        response = null // Clear for next command
        CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch { receivedResponse.send(rsp) }
    }
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

{% note %}
We also first parse the response but that will be described in the next section.
{% endnote %}

We can see the individual packets being accumulated in the log:

## Parsing a Query Response

This section is going to describe responses to to BLE status / setting queries. We don't actually
introduce such queries until [the next tutorial]({% link _tutorials/tutorial_4_ble_queries/tutorial.md %}) so
for now, only the parsing of the response is important.

{% tip %}
While multi-packet responses are almost always Query Responses, they can also be from Command Complex
responses. In a real-world implementation, it is therefore necessary to check the received UUID to see
how to parse.
{% endtip %}

Query Responses contain one or more TLV groups in their Response data. To recap, the generic response format is:

| Header (length) | Query ID | Status  | Response         |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 1-2 bytes       | 1 byte   | 1 bytes | Length - 2 bytes |

This means that query responses will contain an array of additional TLV groups in the "Response" field as such:

| ID1    | Length1 | Value1        | ID2    | Length2 | Value 2       | ... | IDN    | LengthN | ValueN        |
| ------ | ------- | ------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------- | --- | ------ | ------- | ------------- |
| 1 byte | 1 byte  | Length1 bytes | 1 byte | 1 byte  | Length2 bytes | ... | 1 byte | 1 byte  | LengthN bytes |

Depending on the amount of query results in the response, this response can be one or multiple packets.
Therefore, we need to account for the possibility that it may always be more than 1 packet.

We can see an example of such parsing in the response parse method as shown below:

---

<div class="md_column">
<div markdown="1">

We have already parsed the length when we were accumulating the packet. So the next step is to parse the Query
ID and Status:

{% linkedTabs id_status_query_response %}
{% tab id_status_query_response python %}
```python
self.id = self.bytes[0]
self.status = self.bytes[1]
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab id_status_query_response kotlin %}
```kotlin
id = packet[0].toInt()
status = packet[1].toInt()
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

We then continuously parse **Type (ID) - Length - Value** groups until we have consumed the response. We are
storing each value in a hash map indexed by ID for later access.

{% linkedTabs tlv_query_response %}
{% tab tlv_query_response python %}
```python
buf = self.bytes[2:]
while len(buf) > 0:
    # Get ID and Length
    param_id = buf[0]
    param_len = buf[1]
    buf = buf[2:]
    # Get the value
    value = buf[:param_len]

    # Store in dict for later access
    self.data[param_id] = value

    # Advance the buffer
    buf = buf[param_len:]
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab tlv_query_response kotlin %}
```kotlin
while (buf.isNotEmpty()) {
    // Get each parameter's ID and length
    val paramId = buf[0]
    val paramLen = buf[1].toInt()
    buf = buf.drop(2)
    // Get the parameter's value
    val paramVal = buf.take(paramLen)
    // Store in data dict for access later
    data[paramId] = paramVal.toUByteArray()
    // Advance the buffer for continued parsing
    buf = buf.drop(paramLen)
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endlinkedTabs %}

</div>
<div markdown="1" style="flex:60%">

<br><br><br>

```mermaid!
graph TD
    A[Parse Query ID] --> B[Parse Status]
    B --> C{More data?}
    C --> |yes|D[Get Value ID]
    D --> E[Get Value Length]
    E --> F[Get Value]
    F --> C
    C --> |no|G(done)
```

</div>
</div>

In the tutorial demo, we then log this entire dict after parsing is complete as such (abbreviated for brevity):

You can now parse any TLV response that is received from the GoPro, at least if it is received uninterrupted.
There is additional logic required for a complete solution such as checking the UUID the response is received
on and storing a dict of response per UUID. At the current time, this endeavor is left for the reader. For a
complete example of this, see the [Open GoPro Python SDK](https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/python_sdk/).
