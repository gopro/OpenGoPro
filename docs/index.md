# Getting Started

Open GoPro is an API for interacting with GoPro cameras that is developed and managed directly by GoPro.
It provides developers and companies with an easy-to-use programming interface and helps integrate the cameras
into their ecosystems. The API works with off-the-shelf cameras with standard firmware, is free-to-use under
MIT license, and publicly available online on GitHub.

# Compatibility

Open GoPro API is supported on all camera models since Hero 9 with the following firmware version requirements:

| Camera             | Minimum FW Version |
| ------------------ | :----------------: |
| Hero 12 Black      |     v01.10.00      |
| Hero 11 Black Mini |     v01.10.00      |
| Hero 11 Black      |     v01.10.00      |
| Hero 10 Black      |     v01.10.00      |
| Hero 9 Black       |     v01.70.00      |

While we strive to provide the same API functionality and logic for all newly launched cameras, minor changes
are sometimes necessary. These are typically a consequence of HW component upgrades or improving or optimizing
FW architecture. Therefore support for some functions and commands might be model-specific. This is
described in the compatibility tables in the documentation.

# Interfaces

Users can interact with the camera over BLE, WiFi, or wired USB. Both Wifi and USB are operated through HTTP
server with identical commands. It is important to note that due to hard constraints of power and the hardware
design, some commands in Wi-Fi are not available in BLE, and vice-versa.

## Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

BLE is the fastest way to control the cameras and allow command and control functionality. BLE advertising is used
for initial camera pairing. BLE is a requirement for any type of Wireless control since camera WiFi must be
enabled upon each connection via BLE.

## WiFi

WiFi needs to be switched on by a BLE command. Besides command & control, Wi-Fi also allows for video streaming and media
manipulation. With the exception of live-streaming, the camera always acts as an Wi-Fi access point that other devices
need to connect to. For more information, see the [HTTP Specification]({{site.baseurl}}/http).

## USB

The USB connection can provide both data transfer and power to the camera. The power provided by the USB is
sufficient for the camera to run indefinitely without the internal battery. However, the wired connection
doesn't allow for programmatic power on and off. Camera needs to be switched on manually or via BLE, and
after the camera goes to sleep, it must be “woken up” again with a button press or via BLE. For monitoring
and other use cases where the camera must be operated and switched on and off only via USB cable, there is a
workaround with the Labs firmware - more detail in the [FAQ]({% link faq.md %}).

# Control Camera and Record Remotely

Here is a summary of currently supported per-interface features:

| Feature                | BLE | WiFi | USB |
| ---------------------- | --- | ---- | --- |
| Retrieve Camera State  | ✔️  | ✔️   | ✔️  |
| Change Settings / Mode | ✔️  | ✔️   | ✔️  |
| Encode (Press shutter) | ✔️  | ✔️   | ✔️  |
| Stream Video           |     | ✔️   | ✔️  |
| Media Management       |     | ✔️   | ✔️  |
| Metadata Extraction    |     | ✔️   | ✔️  |
| Camera Connect / Wake  | ✔️  |      |     |

BLE, WiFi, and USB can be used to change settings and modes, start and stop capture, query remaining battery
life, SD card capacity, or camera status (such as "is it recording?").  Most command-and-control functionality is
disabled while the camera is recording video or is otherwise busy.

There are 3 main recording modes for the cameras: photo, video, and timelapse.
Within each mode, one can choose different frame rates, resolutions and FOV options. Note that not all cameras
have all 3 recording modes, not all settings combinations are available for all camera models. The specification
section links to json and xls files that show all available setting combinations per camera model.

# Stream Video

Besides recording, the cameras can also stream video feed. The API provides 3 different ways to stream videos
directly from the cameras, either via USB or wireless connection.

| Stream Type | Description                                   | WiFi | USB | Record while Streaming |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | :--: | :-: | :--------------------: |
| : Preview : | Moderate video quality, primarily for framing |      |     |   \`>=\` Hero 12 \     |
| Stream      | Low latency stabilization                     |  ✔️  | ✔️  |           \            |
|             | Low power consumption                         |      |     |                        |
| : Webcam :  | Cinematic video quality                       |      |     |           \            |
| Mode        | Optional low latency stabilization            |  ✔️  | ✔️  |                        |
| : Live :    | Cinematic video quality                       |      |     |           \            |
| Stream      | Optional hypersmooth stabilization            |  ✔️  |     |           ✔️           |

Each of the streaming types has different resolutions, bit rates, imaging pipelines, and different levels of
configurability. Refer to the [FAQ]({% link faq.md %}).

# Manipulate and Transfer Media Files

When the camera records video, time lapse, or photo, the media is saved on the SD card with filenames according
to the GoPro [File Naming Convention](https://community.gopro.com/s/article/GoPro-Camera-File-Naming-Convention).

The cameras always record two versions of each video file

-   Full resolution based on the selected settings (`.mp4`)
-   Low resolution video proxy (`.lrv`) that can be used for editing or other operations where file size matters.

The `lrv` file type can be renamed to `mp4` and used for playback or further editing. Both versions
exist in the same folder on the SD card. In addition, the cameras generate a thumbnail image (`.thm`) for each media
file. The `thm` file type can be changed to `jpeg` if required.

All three file types can be accessed, deleted, or copied via API commands.

# Extract Metadata

GoPro cameras write metadata in each file, using a proprietary [GPMF](https://github.com/gopro/gpmf-parser)
format. The metadata contains information including gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS, imaging-specific metadata, and several computed metrics such as scene classification.

The metadata file cannot be edited or read while the camera is recording but can be accessed after the file
has been written either entirely or selectively for a specific metric such as GPS.

# Use Multiple Cameras Simultaneously

Controlling multiple cameras from one client is supported via BLE, Wifi, and USB with varying functionality
depending on the protocol used. Refer to the table below.

| Protocol | Available Functionality                                                      | Notes                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BLE      | Command and control of several cameras                                       | Each camera can connect only to one BLE-enabled device at a time |
| WiFi     | Command and control in Wi-fi station mode (COHN)                             | COHN is available only from HERO12 onwards \                     |
|          | Webcam and Preview Stream in Wi-fi station mode (COHN) Live-streaming (RTMP) | RTMP stream must be initiated via BLE                            |
| USB      | Command and control and streaming via Webcam mode                            | Available only from HERO11 onward                                |

# Use GoPro Cloud and Editing Engine

The GoPro ecosystem includes a multitude of ways to edit, store, and replay content
which are currently available for end-users as a part of paid subscription programs. Even when integrated
into your ecosystem, GoPro cameras can take advantage of cloud backup and editing tools provided by GoPro
including auto-upload to the cloud, automatic editing, and native live streaming.

The GoPro cloud interface has been tailored to the needs of individual consumers. If you are interested in
commercial usage, reach out to our business development team.
