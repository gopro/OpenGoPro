# Python Tutorial 3: Parse BLE TLV Responses

This document will provide a walk-through tutorial to use [bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/) to implement
the [Open GoPro Interface]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}) to parse BLE
[Type-Length-Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value) (TLV) Responses.

Besides TLV, some BLE commands instead return protobuf responses. These will be discussed in a future
tutorial.

{% warning %}
It is required that you have first completed the
[connect]({% link _python-tutorials/tutorial_1_connect_ble.md %}#requirements)
and [sending commands]({% link _python-tutorials/tutorial_2_send_ble_commands.md %}) tutorials before going
through this tutorial.
{% endwarning %}

This tutorial will give an overview of types of responses, then give examples of parsing each type
before finally providing a **Response** class that will be used in future tutorials.

# Requirements

It is assumed that the hardware and software requirements from the
[connect tutorial]({% link _python-tutorials/tutorial_1_connect_ble.md %})
are present and configured correctly.

The scripts that will be used for this tutorial can be found in the
[Tutorial 3 Folder](https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro/tree/main/demos/python/tutorial/tutorial_modules/tutorial_3_parse_ble_tlv_responses).

# Just Show me the Demo(s)!!
If you just want to run the demo, you can find Python scripts for each of the concepts in this tutorial in the [Open GoPro GitHub repo]( https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro).

{% warning %}
Python >= 3.8.x must be used as specified in the requirements
{% endwarning %}

{% note %}
Each of the scripts for this tutorial can be found in this directory of the repo: 
`demos/python/tutorial/tutorial_modules/tutorial_3_parse_ble_tlv_responses/`
{% endnote %}

{% accordion Parsing a One Packet TLV Response %}

You can test parsing a one packet TLV response with your camera through BLE using the following script:
```console
$ python ble_command_get_version.py
```

See the help for parameter definitions:

```console
$ python ble_command_get_version.py --help
usage: ble_command_get_version.py [-h] [-i IDENTIFIER]

Connect to a GoPro camera via BLE, then get the Open GoPro version.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IDENTIFIER, --identifier IDENTIFIER
                        Last 4 digits of GoPro serial number, which is the last 4 digits of the
                        default camera SSID. If not used, first discovered GoPro will be connected to
```
{% endaccordion %}


{% accordion Parsing Multiple Packet TLV Responses %}

You can test parsing multiple packet TVL responses with your camera through BLE using the following script:
```console
$ python ble_command_get_state.py
```

See the help for parameter definitions:

```console
$ python ble_command_get_state.py --help
usage: ble_command_get_state.py [-h] [-i IDENTIFIER]

Connect to a GoPro camera via BLE, then get its statuses and settings.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i IDENTIFIER, --identifier IDENTIFIER
                        Last 4 digits of GoPro serial number, which is the last 4 digits of the
                        default camera SSID. If not used, first discovered GoPro will be connected to
```
{% endaccordion %}

# Setup

We must first connect as was discussed in the
[connect tutorial]({% link _python-tutorials/tutorial_1_connect_ble.md %}). When enabling notifications,
one of the notification handlers described in the following sections will be used.

# Response Overview

In the preceding tutorials, we have been using a very simple response handling procedure where the notification
handler simply checks that the UUID is the expected UUID and that the status byte of the response is 0 (Success).
This has been fine since we were only sending specific commands where this works and we know that the sequence
always appears as such (connection sequence left out for brevity):

```mermaid!
sequenceDiagram
  participant PC as Open GoPro user device
  participant GoPro
  note over PC, GoPro : devices are connected as in Tutorial 1
  PC ->> GoPro: Write to characteristic
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 0 (start))
```

In actuality, responses can be more complicated. As described in the
[Open GoPro Interface]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}#packet-headers), responses can be
be comprised of multiple packets where each packet is <= 20 bytes such as:

```mermaid!
sequenceDiagram
  participant PC as Open GoPro user device
  participant GoPro
  note over PC, GoPro : devices are connected as in Tutorial 1
  PC ->> GoPro: Write to characteristic
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 0 (start))
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 1 (continuation))
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 1 (continuation))
  GoPro ->> PC: Notification Response (MSB == 1 (continuation))
```

This requires the implementation of accumulating and parsing algorithms which will be described in
[Parsing Multiple Packet TLV Responses].

# Parsing a One Packet TLV Response

This section will describe how to parse one packet (<= 20 byte) responses. A one-packet response
is formatted as such:

| Header (length) | Command / Setting ID | Status  | Response         |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 1 byte          | 1 byte               | 1 bytes | Length - 2 bytes |

## Command / Setting Responses with Response Length 0

These are the only responses that we have seen thus far through the first 2 tutorials. They
return a status but have a 0 length additional response. For example, consider
[Set Shutter]({% link _python-tutorials/tutorial_2_send_ble_commands.md %}#set-shutter). It returned a response
of:

```
02:01:00
```

This equates to:

| Header (length) | Command / Setting / Status ID | Status          | Response         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 1 byte          | 1 byte                        | 1 bytes         | Length - 2 bytes |
| 0x02            | 0x01 == Set Shutter           | 0x00 == Success | (2 -2 = 0 bytes) |

We can see how this response includes the status but no additional response data. This type of
response will be used for most Commands and Setting Responses as seen in the
[previous tutorial]({% link _python-tutorials/tutorial_2_send_ble_commands.md %}).

## Complex Command Response

There are some commands that do return additional response data. These are called "complex responses."
From the [commands reference]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}#commands-quick-reference), we can see that these are:

-   Get Open GoPro Version (ID == 0x51)
-   Get Hardware Info (ID == 0x3C)

The `ble_command_get_version.py` script demonstrates a simple parser for the Open GoPro
Get Version command which we will walk through here.

{% tip %}
It is important to always query the version after connecting in order to know which API is supported.
See the relevant version of the BLE and / or WiFi spec for more details about each version.
{% endtip %}

First, we send the command to the Command Request [UUID]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}#services-and-characteristics):

```python
COMMAND_REQ_UUID = GOPRO_BASE_UUID.format("0072")
event.clear()
await client.write_gatt_char(COMMAND_REQ_UUID, bytearray([0x01, 0x51]))
await event.wait()  # Wait to receive the notification response
```

{% note %}
The snippets of code included in this section are taken from the `notification handler`
{% endnote %}

We then receive a response at the expected handle. This is logged as:

```console
INFO:root:Getting the Open GoPro version...
INFO:root:Received response at handle=52: b'06:51:00:01:01:01:00'
```

This equates to:

| Header (length) | Command / Setting / Status ID | Status          | Response            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 byte          | 1 byte                        | 1 bytes         | Length - 2 bytes    |
| 0x06            | 0x51 == Get Version           | 0x00 == Success | 0x01 0x01 0x01 0x00 |

We can see that this "complex response" contains 4 additional bytes that need to be parsed. Using the information
from the [interface description]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}#complex-command-responses),
we know to parse this as:

| Byte | Meaning                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 0x01 | Length of Major Version Number |
| 0x01 | Major Version Number           |
| 0x01 | Length of Minor Version Number |
| 0x00 | Minor Version Number           |

We implement this in the notification handler as follows. First, we parse the length, command ID, and status
from the first 3 bytes of the response:

```python
len = data[0]
command_id = data[1]
status = data[2]
```

Next we parse the remaining four bytes of the response as individual values formatted as such:

| Length | Value        |
| ------ | ------------ |
| 1 byte | Length bytes |

```python
index = 3
params = []
while index <= len:
    param_len = data[index]
    index += 1
    params.append(data[index : index + param_len])
    index += param_len
```

From the complex response definition, we know these parameters equate to the major and the minor version so
let's print them (and all of the other response information) as such:

```python
major, minor = params
logger.info(f"Received a response to {command_id=} with {status=}: version={major[0]}.{minor[0]}")
```

which shows on the log as:

```console
INFO:root:Received a response to command_id=81 with status=0: version=1.0
```

**Quiz time! 📚 ✏️**

    question="What is the maximum size of an individual notification response packet?"
    option="A:::20 bytes"
    option="B:::256 bytes"

# Parsing Multiple Packet TLV Responses

This section will describe parsing TLV responses that contain more than one packet. It will first describe how
to accumulate such responses and then provide a parsing example. The example script that will be walked through
for this section is `ble_command_get_state.py`. We will be creating a small _Response_ class that will be
re-used for future tutorials.

## Accumulating the Response

The first step is to accumulate the multiple packets into one response. Whereas for all tutorials until now, we
have just used the header bytes of the response as the length, we now must completely parse the header as it is
defined:

<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="8">Byte 1</td>
        <td colspan="8">Byte 2 (optional)</td>
        <td colspan="8">Byte 3 (optional)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0: Start</td>
        <td colspan="2">00: General</td>
        <td colspan="5">Message Length: 5 bits</td>
        <td colspan="16"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0: Start</td>
        <td colspan="2">01: Extended (13-bit)</td>
        <td colspan="13">Message Length: 13 bits</td>
        <td colspan="8"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0: Start</td>
        <td colspan="2">10: Extended (16-bit)</td>
        <td colspan="5"></td>
        <td colspan="16">Message Length: 16 bits</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0: Start</td>
        <td colspan="2">11: Reserved</td>
        <td colspan="21"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1: Continuation</td>
        <td colspan="24"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The basic algorithm here (which is implemented in the _Message.accumulate_ method) is as follows:

---

<div class="md_column">
<div markdown="1">
Continuation bit set?

```python
if buf[0] & CONT_MASK:
    buf.pop(0)
else:
    ...
```

No, continuation bit was not set. So create new response, then get its length.

```python
# This is a new packet so start with an empty byte array
self.bytes = bytearray()
hdr = Header((buf[0] & HDR_MASK) >> 5)
if hdr is Header.GENERAL:
    self.bytes_remaining = buf[0] & GEN_LEN_MASK
    buf = buf[1:]
elif hdr is Header.EXT_13:
    self.bytes_remaining = ((buf[0] & EXT_13_BYTE0_MASK) << 8) + buf[1]
    buf = buf[2:]
elif hdr is Header.EXT_16:
    self.bytes_remaining = (buf[1] << 8) + buf[2]
    buf = buf[3:]
```

Append current packet to response and decrement bytes remaining.

```python
# Append payload to buffer and update remaining / complete
self.bytes.extend(buf)
self.bytes_remaining -= len(buf)
```

In the notification handler, we are then parsing if there are no bytes remaining.

```python
    if response.is_received:
        response.parse()
```

</div>

<div markdown="1" style="60%">
<br><br><br>
```mermaid!
graph TD
    A[Read Available Packet] --> C{Continuation bit set?}
    C -->|No| D[Create new empty response]
    D --> I[Get bytes remaining, i.e. length]
    I --> E
    C -->|Yes| E[Append packet to accumulating response]
    E --> |Decrement bytes remaining| F{Bytes remaining == 0?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Parse Received Packet]
    F -->|No| A
```
</div>
</div>

---

We can see this in action when we send the _Get All Setting Values_ Query.

{% note %}
Queries aren't introduced until the next tutorial so for now, just pay attention to the response.
{% endnote %}

We send the command as such:

```python
QUERY_REQ_UUID = GOPRO_BASE_UUID.format("0076")
event.clear()
await client.write_gatt_char(QUERY_REQ_UUID, bytearray([0x01, 0x12]))
await event.wait()  # Wait to receive the notification response
```

Then, in the notification handler, we continuously receive and accumulate packets until we have
received the entire response, at which point we notify the writer that the response is ready:

```python
 def notification_handler(handle: int, data: bytes) -> None:
        response.accumulate(data)

        if response.is_received:
            response.parse()

            # Notify writer that procedure is complete
            event.set()
```

{% note %}
We also first parse the response but that will be described in the next section.
{% endnote %}

We can see the individual packets being accumulated in the log:

```console

```

At this point the response has been accumulated. See the next section for how to parse it.

**Quiz time! 📚 ✏️**

    question="How can we know that a response has been completely received?"
    option="A:::The stop bit will be set in the header"
    option="B:::The response has accumulated length bytes"

    correct="B"
    info="The length of the entire response is parsed from the first packet. We
        then accumulate packets, keeping track of the received length, until all of the bytes
        have been received. A and C are just made up 😜."
%}

## Query Responses

This section is going to describe responses to to BLE status / setting queries. We don't actually
introduce such queries until [the next tutorial]({% link _python-tutorials/tutorial_4_ble_queries.md %}) so
for now, only the parsing of the response is important.

{% tip %}
While multi-packet responses are almost always Query Responses, they can also be from Command Complex \
responses. In a real-world implementation, it is therefore necessary to check the received UUID to see
how to parse.
{% endtip %}

Query Responses contain one or more TLV groups in their Response data. To recap, the generic response format is:

| Header (length) | Query ID | Status  | Response         |
| --------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| 1-2 bytes       | 1 byte   | 1 bytes | Length - 2 bytes |

This means that query responses will contain an array of additional TLV groups in the "Response" field as such:

| ID1    | Length1 | Value1        | ID2    | Length2 | Value 2       | ... | IDN    | LengthN | ValueN        |
| ------ | ------- | ------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------- | --- | ------ | ------- | ------------- |
| 1 byte | 1 byte  | Length1 bytes | 1 byte | 1 byte  | Length2 bytes | ... | 1 byte | 1 byte  | LengthN bytes |

Depending on the amount of query results in the response, this response can be one or multiple packets.
Therefore, we need to account for the possibility that it may always be more than 1 packet.

We can see an example of such parsing in the **Response.parse** method:

---

<div class="md_column">
<div markdown="1">

We have already parsed the length when we were accumulating the packet. So the next step is to parse the Query
ID and Status:

```python
self.id = self.bytes[0]
self.status = self.bytes[1]
```

We then continuously parse **Type (ID) - Length - Value** groups until we have consumed the response. We are
storing each value in a dict indexed by ID for later access.

```python
buf = self.bytes[2:]
while len(buf) > 0:
    # Get ID and Length
    param_id = buf[0]
    param_len = buf[1]
    buf = buf[2:]
    # Get the value
    value = buf[:param_len]

    # Store in dict for later access
    self.data[param_id] = value

    # Advance the buffer
    buf = buf[param_len:]
```

</div>
<div markdown="1" style="flex:60%">

<br><br><br>

```mermaid!
graph TD
    A[Parse Query ID] --> B[Parse Status]
    B --> C{More data?}
    C --> |yes|D[Get Value ID]
    D --> E[Get Value Length]
    E --> F[Get Value]
    F --> C
    C --> |no|G(done)
```

</div>
</div>

---

In the demo, we then log this entire dict after parsing is complete as such (abbreviated for brevity):

```console
INFO:root:Received settings
: {
    "2": "09",
    "3": "01",
    "5": "00",
    "6": "01",
    "13": "01",
    "19": "00",
    "30": "00:00:00:00",
    "31": "00",
    "32": "00:00:00:0a",
    "41": "09",
    "42": "05",
    "43": "00",
    ...
    "153": "00",
    "154": "01",
    "155": "00",
    "156": "00",
    "157": "00",
    "158": "01",
    "159": "00",
    "160": "00",
    "161": "00",
    "162": "00",
    "163": "01",
    "164": "00",
    "165": "00",
    "166": "00",
    "167": "04",
    "168": "00:00:00:00",
    "169": "01"
}
```

We can see what each of these values mean by looking at the
[Open GoPro Interface]({% link specs/ble_versions/ble_2_0.md %}#settings-quick-reference).

For example:

-   ID 2 == 9 equates to Resolution == 1080
-   ID 3 == 1 equates to FPS == 120

{% quiz
    question="How many packets are query responses?"
    option="A:::Always 1 packet"

You can now parse any TLV response that is received from the GoPro, at least if it is received uninterrupted.
There is additional logic required for a complete solution such as checking the UUID the response is received
on and storing a dict of response per UUID. At the current time, this endeavor is left for the reader. For a
complete example of this, see the [Open GoPro Python SDK](https://gopro.github.io/OpenGoPro/python_sdk/).
