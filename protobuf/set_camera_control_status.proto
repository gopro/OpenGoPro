 * Set Camera Control Status (as part of Global Behaviors feature)
 *
 * This command is used to tell the camera that the app (i.e. External Control) wishes to claim control of the camera.
 * This causes the camera to immediately exit most contextual menus and return to the idle screen. Any interaction with
 * the camera's physical buttons will cause the camera to reclaim control and update control status accordingly. If the
 * user returns the camera UI to the idle screen, the camera updates control status to Idle.
 *
 * The entity currently claiming control of the camera is advertised in camera status 114. Information about whether the
 * camera is in a contextual menu or not is advertised in camera status 63.

 * Response: @ref ResponseGeneric
